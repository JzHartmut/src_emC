 * @content: This file contains all methods from CRuntimeJavalike which have access to the operation system level.
 * Only the routines here uses the os_wrapper.h and are dependent on it. All other routines are os-independent.
 * The os_wrapper.h defines the interface to the operation system in a os-independently way.
 * But the os_wrapper.h may be adapted to os-requirements in the future. So only this source is involved.

/**Version and History.
 * 2015-08-16 JcHartmut: There is a mistake while creating a new [[synchronized(...)]]:
 *  The new id for a ObjectJc::idSyncHandles was stored before the handleMutex was set in the referred struct.
 *  That is not a problem on a single core processor because there is no reason to swith the thread context in this time.
 *  But on multicore processing it is possible that a second core runs a thread similar and uses the new stored idSyncHandles
 *  while the handleMutex is not set yet. Then a Nullpointer is given for [[lockMutex_OSemC(...)]] and it crashed.
 *  A fast workarround is: wait 1 ms if the handleMutex==null to give time to finish the creation in the other thread.
 *  Correct fix is: firstly finish the structure for idSyncHandles, then set it to Object::idSyncHandles with an atomic testAndSet.
 *  If it is set already (from another thread in the same time), delete the own created structure data and use the alredy set data instead.
