/**A StringBuilderJc_s is a structure to manage char[]-arrays. 
 * It is derivated and adapted from the content of the java.lang.StringBuffer rsp. java.lang.StringBuilder.
 * Some Java-like methods are supplied, but not all, but some methods are additional 
 * and specifical for usages in C or C++.
 *
 * There are 2 forms of memory layout of this struct:
 * * a) The struct StringBuilderJc_s contains only the count, size and the pointer of the char[...]-buffer.
 * * b) The struct contains the char-buffer itself.
 *
 * The first variant is usefull especially if a C-like text buffer (char* with given size) is located anywhere
 * in the users data structures, and the StringBuilderJc_s-instance is only used temporary to assemble the text in the buffer.
 *
 * The last variant is possible either if a construct like
 *
 * , struct { StringBuilderJc_s b; char _b[46];} myBuilder = 
 * ,   CONST_addSizeStack_StringBuilderJc(&buffer.b, 50);
 *
 * is defined and initialized or if the [[ctorO_StringBuilderJc(...)]]-Constructor is called 
 * with an initialized ObjectJc with a size greater than sizeof(StringBuilderJc_s). It means more memory was allocated.
 * That variant needs only 1 memory block for the buffer management and the buffer itself.
 *
 * The StringBuilderJc_s-instance holds some flags such as ''located in the Thread Context'' or ''buffer is located in Stack''
 * and ''truncated'', see the appropriate methods. The internal attributes of this struct should not use immediately,
 * only the methods of this C-class should be used.
 *
 * '''Problem of reallocating a buffer''': In Java it's some more easier: Working with dynamically memory is usual, 
 * and the buffer is a private element of the StringBuilder. Therefore the buffer can be changed anytime, 
 * only a few amount of calculation time is need.
 *
 * But in C the StringBuilderJc_s is often associated with a determined buffer of the user. The user shows to its buffer,
 * The StringBuilder-instance is only a helper to deal with the content. A situation, that an unexpected overflow of the buffer size
 * occurs during an append operation, than the StringBuilder swaps the content in a new allocated buffer, will be a confusion.
 * The user looks to its buffer, no content is changed, why? He doesn't look to the StringBuilder-Instance.
 *
 * Because on other side the handling with dynamically memory is restricted often in C-applications, the reallocation of buffer
 * is only suitable by calling the method ,,ensureCapacity,,. This method is not supported in this version, but it may be supported.
 * Than the user is responsible to the correctness of handling with its old buffer. If the user ensures actively, it should look what it means.
 * If the [[BlockHeap]] or an adequate mechanism with equal-size-blocks are used for dynamically memory-management, 
 * a new allocated buffer has the highest size of block which are possible in the system. So an enhancement of capacity is not possible.
 * The system limit of equal size blocks are decisive anyway. An increasing is not possible, because the highest size is given anyway.
 *
 * The allocation is not limited in startup-phase using [[BlockHeap]], but in a startup phase the allocated memory is used
 * as fix memory on runtime. An accidental buffer for a String-building is not desired mostly.  
 *
 * Therefore the concept is: An enhancement of content never changes the buffer. 
 * Either an exception is thrown (to detect maybe an error of given conditions) or an truncation is done.
