 * The handle is 32 bit. For a 32-bit-target system this translation is not necessary, because the 32-bit-ptr can be used as handle value immediately.
 * The translation of a pointer to a handle allows to use a 32-bit-connection between independent function blocks, which works with the same memory.
 * Especially it is firstly used for simulink S-functions running on the 64-bit-PC platform.
