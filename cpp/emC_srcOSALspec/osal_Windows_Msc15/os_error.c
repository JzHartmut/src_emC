 * @content This file contains the implementation of error handling for the OSAL-wrapper.
 *          The error handling depends on the realities of the given system and its environment.
 *          Therefore an adaption for several platforms may be necessary here.
 
 * @author Hartmut Schorrig www.vishia.org
 * @version 0.94
 * list of changes:
 * 2011-01-07 Hartmut chg: Written in an extra file, before them, it was stored in os_thread.c
 * 2010-01-15 Hartmut corr: errorhandling should be improved! Usage of  printf in a file? It was resolved already. Depends on system.
 * 2007-10-01: Hartmut creation (concept)
