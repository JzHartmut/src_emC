 * @content Bodies of mutex routines for Windows-XP and Windows-2000.
 * The implementation is os-specific. A mutex should regard a second call from the same thread.
 * It is more complex as a simple semaphore request. 
 * Some operation systems supports this request immediately. 
 * If a opeation system does know only the semaphore mechanism, the thread identification
 *   should be stored in a mutex structure.
